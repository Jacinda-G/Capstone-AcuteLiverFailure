# Capstone-AcuteLiverFailure
 Capstone 2 acute liver failure predictors
Acute Liver Failure is a rare disease in which damage to the liver creates a loss of function. While there are many known diseases that cause ALF, treatment at the current time is limited and often involves transplant.Identifying patient demographic risk factors,may allow for earlier screening and prevention to improve patient outcome. 

The aim of this model is to use this data set to find feature data most correlated with ALF. Modeling this will allow us not only to have a better understanding of risks related to ALF, but will also help predict a patientâ€™s predisposition to ALF when key indicators are considered.
